Quickstart Buttons
==================

Quickstart Buttons is an open source (MIT) extra for MODX, developed by [modmore](https://www.modmore.com). It assists you in creating a dashboard widget with big buttons, to provide your users easy access to common functionality.

Credits go to Christian Seel, who first pioneered the idea of big buttons in 2013, and Bert Oost, who worked for modmore at the time to build out the first version of this extra.

If you'd like to contribute to the styling of Quickstart Buttons, please find the README.md file under `_build/templates/` for detailed instructions on using the grunt workflow.
